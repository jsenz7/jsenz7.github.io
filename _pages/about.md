I’m **Sen Zhang (张森)**, a researcher and engineer working at the intersection of **smart textiles, soft robotics, and wearable sensing**. I am currently a postdoctoral scholar in Electrical & Computer Engineering at the **University of Washington**, working with Prof. Yiyue Luo.

My work focuses on creating **machine-knitted, multimodal textile systems** that can sense muscle activity, joint motion, and contact forces, and that can also provide **haptic feedback**. I am especially excited about applications in **in-home neurorehabilitation** and long-term health monitoring.

Some of the projects I am currently involved in include:

- **MultiSensKnit** – a multimodal smart textile sleeve that integrates EMG, electrical impedance tomography (EIT), and joint motion tracking for home-based rehabilitation.
- **MagTex** – a magnetoactive knitted textile that unifies sensing and vibrotactile haptics for bidirectional human–machine interface.
- **FingerGlove** – a knitted glove with embedded sensing and haptics for real-time gesture control and interactive applications.

Alongside my research, I am exploring **entrepreneurial pathways** to translate these technologies into real-world products, as part of the **UW ECE Entrepreneurial Fellows Program**. I enjoy collaborating with clinicians, engineers, and designers to bridge advanced textile manufacturing with impactful healthcare applications.
